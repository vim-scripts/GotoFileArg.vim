GotoFileArg.vim v0.9b

Mostly for those who load up VIM with a lot of files at once in the arg list.
When jumping around in files, this allows you to jump right to a file, by a
substring/regex of the filename.  It repositions VIM in the arg list so
subsequent :n :N commands work from the actual location of the file.

At present it also maps esc-f as the keystroke to type the filename in.
(esc-f is alt-f / meta1-f on my system, and many others).

Features:
  * Filename match is done using "=~" so a substring / regex are fine
  * Last pattern is remembered
  * If the current filename matches, the search, as one would expect, begins
at the next file, and wraps.
